    INSTEAD OF

    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    }
    in package.json!

    WE CAN SAY

    "scripts": {
        "dev": "node backend/server.js"
    }

    such that in terminal we just have to say "npm run dev" instead of 
    "node backend/server.js"
